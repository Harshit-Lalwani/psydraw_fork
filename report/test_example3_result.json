        "analysis": "Here is a psychological interpretation of the visual features observed in the \"Person\" drawing:\n\n1.  **Stick Figure Representation:** Suggests emotional immaturity, a simplified self-concept, or a defensive avoidance of self-disclosure. May indicate feelings of inadequacy or a lack of integrated body image.\n2.  **Large Head:** Emphasis on intellectualization, fantasy, or a preoccupation with mental activity. Can indicate a desire for intellectual control or a feeling of being \"in one's head.\"\n3.  **Simple Facial Features (Eyes, Smiling Mouth, No Nose/Ears):** Superficial social engagement; the smile may be a conventional attempt to appear agreeable or mask true feelings. Lack of nose/ears suggests reduced interest in social input or a defensive posture against criticism.\n4.  **Smiling Mouth:** A conscious effort to appear pleasant or cooperative, potentially masking underlying emotions. May reflect a desire for social acceptance or a reluctance to express negative affect.\n5.  **Hair Present:** Some attention to appearance or vitality, even if simply drawn. Can relate to a basic sense of self-identity or energy.\n6.  **No Neck:** Difficulty connecting thoughts (head) and feelings/impulses (body). May indicate poor emotional flexibility or challenges in impulse control.\n7.  **Thin, Stick-like Torso:** Feelings of vulnerability, fragility, or a lack of emotional substance. Suggests a weak or underdeveloped sense of self-worth and body image.\n8.  **Thin, Stick-like Arms:** Limited or hesitant engagement with the environment. May indicate feelings of powerlessness, difficulty asserting oneself, or a reluctance to reach out socially.\n9.  **Simple, Claw-like Hands:** Primitive or somewhat aggressive mode of interaction, or feelings of inadequacy in effectively manipulating the environment or relating to others.\n10. **Thin, Stick-like Legs:** Lack of grounding, instability, or feelings of inadequacy in moving forward or standing firm. Suggests a fragile sense of support and agency.\n11. **Simple, Pointed Feet:** Tentative or unstable contact with reality. May suggest a desire to move quickly or a lack of firm foundation.\n12. **Overall Light Line Pressure (inferred):** Suggests timidity, indecisiveness, low energy, or a tentative approach to life. May indicate anxiety or a lack of conviction in self-expression.\n13. **Dynamic, Walking Pose:** Despite the fragility, the figure is attempting to move forward, suggesting some underlying drive or an effort to engage with the world, even if tentatively."

    "final": "### HTP \"Person\" Analysis Summary\n\n**Feature: Figure Size, Placement, and Stance**\n*   **Observation:** The figure is of average to moderately large size, centered slightly towards the upper half of the page, depicted in a dynamic, walking pose with legs apart and arms slightly outstretched.\n*   **Interpretation:** The dynamic pose suggests an underlying drive or an effort to engage with the world, even if tentatively. The moderately large size, combined with other features, may reflect a desire to be seen or a compensatory effort despite underlying fragility.\n\n**Feature: Stick Figure Representation and Simplification**\n*   **Observation:** The figure is drawn as an extremely simplified stick figure, lacking detailed trunk, clothing, or distinct feet.\n*   **Interpretation:** This suggests emotional immaturity, a simplified self-concept, or a defensive avoidance of self-disclosure. It may also indicate feelings of inadequacy, a lack of integrated body image, and a weak or underdeveloped sense of self-worth.\n\n**Feature: Head and Facial Features**\n*   **Observation:** The head is large and prominent relative to the stick-figure body. Facial features include two small dot eyes, a simple upward curve for a smile, and scribbled hair, but no nose or ears.\n*   **Interpretation:** The large head suggests an emphasis on intellectualization, fantasy, or preoccupation with mental activity, possibly indicating a desire for intellectual control. The simple, smiling facial features imply superficial social engagement and a conscious effort to appear pleasant, potentially masking true feelings. The absence of a nose and ears suggests reduced interest in social input or a defensive posture against criticism.\n\n**Feature: Body and Limbs**\n*   **Observation:** The trunk is a single vertical line. Arms are single lines extending diagonally downwards with simple \"rake\" or \"stick\" fingers. Legs are single lines spread in a \"V\" shape, ending in points without distinct feet.\n*   **Interpretation:** The thin, stick-like trunk and limbs suggest feelings of vulnerability, fragility, and a lack of emotional substance or body image. The absence of a neck implies difficulty connecting thoughts and feelings. The simple hands indicate a primitive or somewhat aggressive mode of interaction, or feelings of inadequacy in manipulating the environment. The pointed, ungrounded legs suggest a lack of grounding, instability, and tentative contact with reality, reflecting a fragile sense of support and agency.\n\n### Overall Summary\nThe \"Person\" drawing depicts a highly simplified, stick-figure representation, suggesting emotional immaturity and a defensive, somewhat fragile self-concept. Despite this underlying vulnerability, the figure's dynamic, walking pose indicates an effort to engage with the world. A prominent head with a conventional smile points to a reliance on intellectualization and a desire to appear agreeable, potentially masking deeper feelings and a limited capacity for genuine social input.",
